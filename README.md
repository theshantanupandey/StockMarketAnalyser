# MarketMind - Advanced Stock Market Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

**MarketMind** is an advanced stock market analysis dashboard built with Python and Streamlit. It provides real-time stock data, historical analysis, technical indicators, and predictive models to help users make informed investment decisions. The dashboard integrates Evidential Reasoning (ER) and Belief Rule-Based (BRB) systems to provide robust and reliable stock recommendations.

- **Historical Analysis**: Analyze historical stock data with customizable date ranges.
- **Technical Indicators**: Calculate and plot various technical indicators such as SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and more.
- **Predictive Models**: Utilize LSTM, ARIMA, Random Forest, and Prophet models for stock price predictions.
- **News Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze sentiment from recent news articles to gauge market sentiment.
- **Advanced Analysis**: Combine multiple predictive models and technical indicators for a comprehensive analysis.
- **Evidential Reasoning (ER)**: Combine evidence from different models using Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST).
- **Belief Rule-Based (BRB)**: Apply predefined rules to make final stock recommendations based on combined evidence.
